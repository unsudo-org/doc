# Problem Statement

## The Cost of Censorship
Censorship has evolved from a matter of platform policy into a deeply embedded systemic challenge, one with wide-reaching economic, legal, cultural, and human implications. While moderation is often necessary to manage harmful or illegal content, the mechanisms behind censorship today have created a costly and fragile system. The burden of enforcing moderation at scale, navigating increasingly complex legal frameworks, and preserving public trust has become a central obstacle to sustainable growth in the digital ecosystem.
Major platforms now spend billions of dollars annually on moderation infrastructure, including content filters, human reviewers, and appeals systems. These costs continue to rise, driven by pressure to comply with laws such as the EU Digital Services Act and similar regulatory frameworks worldwide. Compliance costs for these laws are not only significant—often reaching into the hundreds of millions—but are also jurisdictionally bounded. This creates a regulatory asymmetry: decentralized systems are largely outside of national legal reach, while centralized companies are left carrying the legal and operational liabilities.
Beyond direct expenses, censorship creates cascading effects on innovation and economic participation. Demonetization policies, advertiser boycotts, and "brand safety" measures lead to lost revenue for both creators and platforms. Startups are particularly disadvantaged, as the cost and complexity of building legally compliant moderation systems become a barrier to entry, stifling innovation before it starts. Even established companies face growing legal risks, with moderation-related lawsuits and settlements now a regular part of operating costs.
The cultural consequences are equally serious. The over-application of censorship leads to a chilling effect, where creators, academics, and ordinary users begin to self-censor to avoid backlash, bans, or reputational harm. Controversial research, minority viewpoints, and dissenting opinions are disproportionately silenced, often under vague or inconsistently enforced policies. As more users lose trust in platforms, many migrate to fringe or unregulated alternatives, reinforcing ideological echo chambers and driving social polarization. The result is a fractured and fragile information ecosystem that discourages open dialogue, weakens public discourse, and homogenizes cultural expression.

At an institutional level, censorship introduces reputational and financial volatility. Companies can suffer stock drops, shareholder lawsuits, and investor divestment following high-profile censorship scandals. Executives are forced to walk a narrow line between appeasing regulators, investors, and vocal user groups — often finding themselves unable to satisfy any side.

Users, meanwhile, are increasingly disempowered. Deplatforming can sever income streams, erase digital identities, and isolate individuals from online communities without due process. Automated moderation systems often collect massive amounts of behavioral data, exposing users to surveillance and algorithmic bias. The long-term erosion of trust in digital services is palpable — users feel monitored, misrepresented, and powerless.

**Real-world examples include:**
- **Facebook–Cambridge Analytica**: Showcased how censorship and data misuse can undermine democracy.
- **Apple in China**: Hosting iCloud data within authoritarian legal systems risks user safety.
- **Covid-19 platform bans**: Users were penalized for views later validated by evidence, undermining platform credibility.
- **TikTok**: Ongoing scrutiny over state surveillance risks leading to national bans and public distrust.
Censorship is no longer just about moderation — it's a **structural liability**. It distorts markets, suppresses creativity, and exacerbates political fragmentation. Its costs fall most heavily on users and creators, while institutions bear growing legal and reputational risks.

To build resilient, open systems for the future, we must recognize censorship for what it has become: **a systemic bottleneck to progress, prosperity, and trust**.
## ↘ The Hidden Cost of Corruption
Corruption is more than a moral failing — it is a systemic threat to economic efficiency, institutional legitimacy, and societal well-being. At every level of governance and enterprise, corrupt practices introduce distortions that erode trust, inflate costs, and undermine progress.

Whether through bribery, cronyism, nepotism, or opaque contracting, corruption drains public resources and favors entrenched interests over innovation and fairness.
### ↡ Key Impacts:
- **Public Funds**: Infrastructure, healthcare, and essential services suffer from inflated contracts and misallocation.
- **Investor Confidence**: Markets plagued by corruption deter foreign investment and transparency.
- **Competition**: Honest businesses are crowded out by those with political connections, damaging fair market dynamics.
- **Institutional Erosion**: Judiciary, media, and regulatory bodies become compromised, further undermining democratic processes.
- **Social Consequences**: Inequality rises as the poor suffer more from weak public services and lack of access.

As corruption becomes normalized, a culture of **impunity and disengagement** spreads. Young talent migrates to fairer systems. Innovation stalls. Institutions collapse inward.
### ↡ Corporate Risks:
- Legal fines, reputational damage, and compliance burdens mount.
- Shareholders see reduced value from scandals and litigation.
- ESG investors pull out.
- Employees and customers lose trust and disengage.

Executives must navigate informal systems and dual governance (official vs. shadow). Time and resources are diverted away from innovation and towards damage control.

In a global economy defined by **transparency and trustless systems**, opacity becomes a liability. Companies enmeshed in corruption lose market access, partnerships, and legitimacy.

> Corruption is a **hidden tax on society** — replacing value creation with value extraction, and fairness with favoritism.
## ↘ Barriers to Blockchain Adoption
Despite the promise of decentralization and financial empowerment, blockchain adoption faces **critical barriers** across technical, cultural, legal, and usability domains.
### ↡ Myth of Decentralization**
Many so-called "decentralized" apps still rely on:
- Centralized servers  
- VC-controlled governance  
- Custodial wallets
This undermines the fundamental ethos and creates points of failure vulnerable to both external and internal pressure.
### ↡ Community Tribalism
Blockchain communities often resist critique, creating echo chambers. This:
- Discourages healthy debate  
- Slows progress on standards and interoperability  
- Hinders public accountability  
### ↡ Regulatory Uncertainty
- Laws are vague or in flux (especially around securities, privacy coins, DeFi).
- Compliance risk is high for both users and builders.
- Legal ambiguity deters innovation and adoption.
### ↡ Censorship at the Infrastructure Layer
Even decentralized protocols rely on centralized services:
- Web hosting (e.g., IPFS gateways, DNS)
- Cloud platforms
- App store distribution
Front-ends can be taken offline, wallets blocked, or content delisted — revealing **fragility beneath the surface**.
### ↡ Poor User Experience
- Private key management is error-prone.
- Wallet UX is complex and fragmented.
- Gas fees and smart contracts are intimidating.
- Mistakes are often irreversible.
### ↡ Architecture Limitations
- On-chain systems are poor at handling real-time interactions.
- Streaming, gaming, or live data often rely on centralized backends.
- Layer 2 and micropayment systems exist, but adoption remains limited due to UX complexity.
### ↡ Developer Burden
Developing for blockchain requires:
- Learning new tools (Solidity, Rust, Move, etc.)
- Managing wallets, gas, security
- Navigating fragmentation between chains
Bugs can be permanent and costly. The mental load is high.
### ↡ Multi-chain Fragmentation
- Bridges are vulnerable and inefficient.
- Cross-chain tools lack maturity.
- Users must juggle assets, risks, and inconsistent interfaces across ecosystems.
### ↡ Security Vulnerabilities
Common threats include:
- Reentrancy attacks  
- Flash loan exploits  
- Oracle manipulation  
- Rug pulls
Insurance exists but is fragmented and underused.
### 10. **Key Management and Identity Recovery**

- Lost private keys = lost assets  
- Social recovery and account abstraction show promise but aren't mainstream  
- No unified identity or recovery across chains

### 11. **Lack of Real-World Utility**

- Most apps still revolve around speculation or DeFi.
- Real-world integrations are rare, clunky, or experimental.
- Enterprises are cautious due to unclear ROI and regulatory friction.
### In Summary:
Blockchain’s full potential remains **locked behind real barriers**:
- Structural: centralized dependencies  
- Cultural: tribalism, elitism  
- Regulatory: hostile or ambiguous legal systems  
- Usability: steep learning curves, poor UX  
- Security: code is law, but few understand the law
Until these are addressed, the promise of Web3 will remain just that — **a promise**.
## ∗ Value Proposition
---
## ↘ Onchain Infrastructure
- Why not just server?
- Long term?
- Resillience?
- Tradeoff?
- Why fundamental to the project.
- Migration concerns?
- Immutability.
- Truely self sovreing code and autonomous machines.
- Transparency.
- Cross border collaboration.
## ↘ Rust as Strategic Foundation
Our choice to build in Rust provides a significant competitive advantage over Solidity and other non-Rust environments. Rust's performance, safety, and versatility make it the ideal foundation for building resilient, high-performance, and scalable decentralized infrastructure.
### ↓ Key Advantages of Building in Rust
#### ↡ Democratizing technologies
- Rust is more available across platforms making it more decentralized, can be run on poor hardware.
- Rust makes it more available for many programmers of various levels to write more robust software, as it is strict and ensures that contributions will reach a certain level of value.
#### ↡ Built-in Safety and Reliability
- Memory-safe by design - no garbage collector, no manual memory management.
- Eliminates entire classes of runtime bugs like buffer overflows and null exceptions.
- Strong static typing and compile-time checks reduce logic errors before deployment.
- Reduces attack surface common in Solidity-based systems.
#### ↡ System-Level Performance and Flexibility
- Compiles to high-performance WebAssembly (WASM) with deterministic execution.
- Supports asynchronous logic and multithreading. Ideal for real-time applications, collaborative tools and streaming data.
- Enables custom runtimes, freeing developers from the constraints of the EVM.
#### ↡ Cross-Platform Efficiency
- Write once, run anywhere. Rust code can power onchain logic, backend services, and even mobile or desktop apps. And remains accessible to anyone even on low powered devices in remote regions.
- It also reduces the energy require where environmental concerns are of importance, and is capable of doing more in environments unconstrained by energy requirements.
- Unified tooling and shared libraries across domains streamline development and reduce operational complexity.
#### ↡ Superior Developer Experience
- Backed by best-in-class tooling: Cargo, Clippy, Rust Analyzer.
- Supported by growing ecosystem of robust, production-ready libraries.
## ↘ Algorithmic Governance and Mathematical Precision
- We dont just want to build a DAO.
- Humans are flawed in their decisions, and Unsudo is an experiment and research to spear head decentralized collaboration across borders. To do so we need a system that is capable of deterministically acting in a rational matter.
- We envision Unsudo to be an autonomous system, as decentralization alsso means to not hold biases.
- **Unsudo** is a research-driven experiment in enabling **truly decentralized collaboration across borders**—without the inconsistencies of human decision-making.
- Human governance is inherently flawed—prone to bias, emotion, and inconsistency. While decentralized systems aim to distribute power, true decentralization also requires **minimizing subjective influence**.
- Unsudo envisions a future where governance is not only **transparent and decentralized**, but also **deterministic and rational**—guided by **algorithmic processes and mathematical principles**.
- We see a DAO that belongs to the community, but is smart enough to govern itself.
- By embedding **mathematical objectivity** into our governance architecture, Unsudo aims to push the boundaries of what DAOs and decentralized systems can achieve—creating not just **tools for coordination**, but **autonomous institutions** that act logically, consistently, and in the collective interest.
- We can fix the problems with current DAO models which are either always and increasingly reliant on a few members to manage and maintain the DAO, or a overly fragmented community which leaves the DAO vulnerable to attacks during low quorum or activity states. The solution is to delagate managment of day-to-day operations to the DAO itself and focus on building next-generation systems that dont act on static instructions, but are capable of performing decisions based on algorithms and policies as mathematical formulas.
- Our mission at Unsudo will be a success if we build a protocol capable of surviving critical inactivity and recover from volatile environments.
## ↘ Abstract Execution Layer
# ∗ Governance
---
Next gen DAO models, embrace algorithms for unbiased decision making vs traditional orgs.
## ↓ Dual Chamber System
- Much like a government Unsudo will operate as a dual chamber system.
- The community will UDO which grants them votes to pass proposals which can directly alter the protocol's code, or require transfers.
- The council will not be able pass proposals alone, they will need support of the wider community to be able to access funds, and pass updates.
- Proposals will need the approval of both chambers, the council only has the power to veto maliscious proposals
### ↘ Veto
A temporary mechanism and ability of the council to be able cancel malicious proposals, naturally this comes with concerns. The council itself cannot pass proposals, and act more as representatives (In its maturity, the DAO should be able to handle itself, but early on, council members must take responsibility for maintaining the project and elevating it to that status).
### ↘ Electoral Mechanism
### ↘ Quorum Algorithm
Base currency are always in ₿ and not $.
## ↓ Tokenomics
- The maximum supply is 1,000,000 and it is a hard cap.
- Voting and governance.

| Reserve          | $325,000$ | $25$    | -           | $8,750,000$ |            |

### ↘ Vesting
The vesting schedule will be linear meaning that tokens unlock on a per second basis from the TGE. The vesting schedules are soft targets for the protocol to honor, and this affects participants both positively or negatively but always in the best interest of the protocol. Unsudo DAO aims to be 99% algorithmic-ally governed, this meanings that the protocol itself has inflationary unlock targets to weight as well. In others words, based on algorithms that can be voted in by people, it can act as a sort of central bank making decisions autonomously. So if it is doing well, it may increase unlocks, but become more reserved if market conditions become volatile, and reduce situations where teams dump on the market. This mechanism is completely third party and self sovereign, meaning it is impartial to all participants once implemented. 
### ↘ Token Value Drivers
### ↘ Liquidity Planning
- Unsudo aims to be decentralization first so initially will be listed on DEXs, however this is still to be confirmed.
- 50,000 will be reserved as liquidity.
### ↘ Compliance & Legal Framework
- The token aims to be a governance token, as well as a commodity  because it is not controlled by any market participant or administration rather indirectly by algorithms voted in by the collective.
- The token or DAO does not take any country or national border as its home, it remains self sovreign.
- There may be a legal wrapper, but this is still to be determined.
- KYC/AML only apply to exchanges where it might be listed on, but Unsudo is largely autonomous, and serves everyone equally.

### ↘ Conversion
#### ↡ Off-Ramp
#### ↡ Volatility
#### ↡ Trust
### ↘ Unlock Rate Mechanism
- Algorithmic, fair, transparent.
- Aligns with protocol performance.
- Helps throttle unlocks in bear markets.
- Motivates stakeholders to maintain health.
$U(t)=(Stotal​−Scirc​(t))⋅[rbase​+(rmax​−rbase​)⋅γ(t)]⋅Δt​$

| Year   | Target Annual Unlock Rate | Circ Cap | Note |
| ------ | ------------------------- | -------- | ---- |
| 2026   | ~15%                      |          |      |
| 2027   | ~10%                      |          |      |
| 3 - 5  | ~5%                       |          |      |
| 6 - 20 | ~3%                       |          |      |

The rules apply to everyone equally.

```rust




type Outflow = Vec<(u32, u32)>;

fn permitted_inflation(
	inflation_target: u32,
	total_supply: u32,
	total_supply_locked: u32,
) -> u32 {

}


inflation(2_00, 1000000_00, 900000_00);
```


```rust
type Vested = (
	total_locked: f32,
	timestamp_begin: u32,
	timestamp_end: u32
);
type LookbackSeconds = usize;

fn compute<const T: LookbackSeconds>(
	timestamp: u32,
	udo_price_history: [f32; T],
	udo_price: f32,
	inflation_rate_history: [f32; T],
	inflation_rate_target: f32,
	inflation_rate: f32,
	growth: f32
) {

}




// chain of responsability - plug in architecture

pub struct Kernel {
	plugins
}

```

### Early Unlock




```rust
fn unlock(
	duration: u32,
	price: u32,
	difficulty: u32,
	lower_range_price: u32,
	upper_range_price: u32
) -> u32 {
	
}
```

## Treasury
### Purpose & Philosophy
- Define the treasury's role: is it simply to fund operations, or is it a long-term sovereign wealth fund? Is it algorithmically managed? This sets the tone for the rest.
- "The Unsudo Treasury is designed as a self-sovereign, algorithmically-influenced financial backbone of the protocol — funding development, incentivizing contributors, and sustaining public goods in a decentralized, trustless manner."
### Revenue Stream
- List and explain where funds come from:
- Protocol fees (if any)
- Block rewards / inflation mechanisms

## Now
## Long Term
The long term vision for Unsudo is to be self sufficient, needing no human input externally to keep operations running, rather to be completely governed by algorithms. A community of-course has to take ownership of the protocol (ideally a group of people located across borders who share the same mission). These people will have power to update and control the protocol through democratic systems. In the absence of people, the protocol will be able to perform electoral processes, asset re balancing, and autonomously maintain itself. The role of council and governance will still be required to further grow the protocol and ecosystem, but it would be safer, and less likely to suffer from centralized causes of failure.
# Team
---
## Role
### Council
- Act a mediator/judge in cases of dispute or governance deadlock.
- Veto proposals that are malicious.
- Oversee day-to-day DAO operation, funding allocation, and management.
- Coordinate task forces and working groups.
- Manage Strategic partnerships.
- Manage external relationships.
- Manage legal entities associated with the DAO.
- Guide the DAO towards progressive decentralization.
- Multisig holders.
#### Accountability and Penalties
To ensure trust, transparency, and integrity in DAO governance, council members are held to a high standard. Abuse of power, negligence, or failure to uphold responsibilities will result in clearly defined penalties.
#### Grounds for Penalty
Council members may be penalized for the following:
- *Conflict of interest*: Failing to disclose relationships or personal gain related to proposals or partnerships.
- *Abuse of veto power*: Repeatedly or arbitrarily vetoing proposals without valid jurisdiction.
###### Negligence
Failure to perform duties such as attending votes, managing multisig, or responding to governance needs.
###### Misuse of funds or access
Unauthorized use of DAO funds or privileged access.
##### Penalty Framework
Penalties are enforced progressively, with severity depending on the infraction and impact:

| Infraction Level | Description | Penalty |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Minor negligence first-time procedural violation | Formal warning; public notice in DAO forum.
| 2 | Repeated negligence, unjustified veto use, moderate conflict of interest | Temporary suspension; multisig access revoked during period
| 3 | Proven abuse of power, financial misconduct, major governance disruption | Immediate dismissal; permanent removal from multisig and council; possible legal referral if applicable

##### Enforcement Process
- Any community member or contributor may submit an abuse report.
- Reports are reviewed by an external auditor.
- Accused members are given the right to respond or appeal.
- Final decisions are subject to a DAO-wide vote for high-severity cases (level 2 or 3).
### ↓ Core Contributors
- Entities contributing on a regular basis of at least 15 hours a week. These are the backbone of thee protocol. 
- Likely involved in implementation, research, dev, ops, or comms depending on the DAO's focus.
- Collaborate with Council, and other working groups.

# System Architecture
---
Unlike many projects Unsudo aims to move slow, and priorities quality over raw development speed. This means we take time to plan out and map out our protocol.
## Rust
- We aimt to support Rust as a first class language within the protocol. Why?
### Security
- Memory safety.
- Compile-time guarantees.
- Avoidance of typical EVM/Solidity bugs such as reentrancy, overflows.
### Cross-Border, Cross-Platform
- Rust code can run everywhere: onchain, offchain, CLI, mobile, or edge devices.
- This allows Unsudo agents and contributors in resource-constrained regions to still operate nodes, run simulations, or participate meaningfully — reinforcing our goal of true global collaboration.
## Polkadot
Polkadot is
### Join Accumulate Machine
Polkadot JAM is a paradigm shift in how compute is allocated, scheduled, and consumed within a decentralized protocol. Rather than locking up entire parachain slots, JAM introduces a **more flexible, modular, and cost-efficient execution model**. It supports **actor-based services** with asynchronous capabilities, executed on-demand via **Coretime**, a new abstraction of decentralized computation.
#### Coretime: Decentralized Compute-as-a-Service
Coretime represents **purchasable slices of execution bandwidth**, rented directly from Polkadot validators. It decouples execution from consensus and enables dynamic workloads. Unlike traditional models that bill per transaction or state write, Coretime enables **scheduled and burst compute**, which is crucial for services like Unsudo.
Coretime comes in two modes:
- *Bulk Coretime*: Reserved in advance — ideal for predictable workloads, similar to leasing virtual machines or containers.
- *Instant Coretime*: Pay-per-use — dynamically acquired to handle unpredictable spikes or user-driven actions.
This abstraction allows protocols like Unsudo to **scale horizontally** — acquiring compute only when necessary, and **releasing it when idle**, dramatically improving capital efficiency.
#### Service
- **Metadata**: Describes the purpose, structure, and permissioning model of the service.
- **Bytecode (PVM)**: Executable logic written in a WASM-compatible language (e.g. Rust).
- **Entrypoints**: Functions like `refine()` or `accumulate()` that govern how state evolves over time or across events.
JAM Services are **first-class citizens** of the chain, capable of **suspending and resuming execution**, orchestrating multi-agent collaboration, or automating governance logic.
#### Modular Execution & Scheduling
JAM supports **deferred or event-driven execution**, rather than requiring computation to happen synchronously in a block. This allows for:
- Real-time simulations
- Periodic policy enforcement
- Off-chain data refinement (e.g. through verifiable compute)
- Coordination between multiple services

### CorePlay: Actor-Based Computation
CorePlay is an **experimental actor-model runtime** built atop JAM’s execution framework. Inspired by Erlang and Akka models, it introduces a **message-passing architecture** for decentralized agents.
#### Agents
CorePlay Agents are **autonomous compute actors** that:
- Run on JAM cores
- Hold local state and logic
- Communicate asynchronously (across cores) or synchronously (on the same core)
- Can spawn other agents or coordinate with services
This model aligns with Unsudo’s vision of **autonomous, self-governing infrastructure**. Each policy, governance logic, or treasury strategy can be encapsulated as a CorePlay agent — independent, auditable, and resilient.
#### Execution and Cost Model
- **Execution is metered via PVM weights** rather than gas.
- **Time slots (~6 seconds)** on cores are scheduled for each agent's execution.
- Cross-core messaging carries higher costs (due to queuing and latency).
- Coretime is either prepaid by the protocol or charged to users indirectly via services.
Unlike Ethereum’s per-transaction gas model, **JAM abstracts away cost from users**, enabling freemium models, background tasks, and coordinated governance computation — perfect for Unsudo’s **algorithmic treasury and policy agents**.
#### Use Cases for Unsudo
- **Patchlet Execution**: Run as agents that evaluate and apply protocol changes.
- **Policy Threads**: Long-running governance rules (e.g. inflation control, treasury policy).
- **Election Agents**: Oversee voting cycles and quorum algorithms.
- **DAO Watchdogs**: Monitor malicious activity and enforce automatic intervention.
- **Recovery Routines**: Trigger safe-state recovery in periods of DAO inactivity.
#### ↡ Service & CorePlay
A JAM service will include metadata and PVM bytecode with entry points like refine and accumulate, allowing modular execution on the JAM chain.

The concept of CorePlay (experimental) posits an actor-based smart contract model, where actors deployed onto JAM cores can call each other asynchronously if on different cores, or synchronously if co-located. All leveraring PVM's ability to suspend and resume execution.

Gas-like Behavior in JAM Service
Allocation of coretime (prepaid)
Service may charge users in DOT, stablecoins, or any token to cover costs.

JAM is more like a "hosting" compute raather than charging per transaction, so more flexible payment options, and abstracting payment from users who may not need to pay for each transaction.

Gas-like Behavior in CorePlay Agent
CorePlay (actor model on JAM) allows asynchronous/synchronous message passing between agents.
Each agent's execution is also metered by PVM weights.

Agents schedule on different cores conssume Coretime for each work package (~6 seconds slots).

The fee model is still evolving, but most likely:
Agent execution consume Coretime directly.

Cross-core calls are more expensive (like einter-contract calls on Ethereum).
Service/agents themselves may expose APIs to change users "gas-like" fees.
