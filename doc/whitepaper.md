# Abstract
---
Unsudo is a Layer 1.5 built on top of JAM.
# Vision
---
We envision Unsudo as a fully self-sovereign, self-governing protocol, a network where people can build and deploy practical tools that feel simple, fast, and intuitive rather than heavy or restrictive. Our goal is to enable anyone, anywhere, to collaborate and transact seamlessly in transparent, verifiable environments that protect freedom and privacy by design. By reducing dependence on centralized intermediaries and lowering operational barriers, Unsudo empowers builders to create meaningful systems and services with less overhead. The result is a more open, efficient, and sustainable digital ecosystem where innovation and governance evolve together.
# Problem Statement
---
Across digital economies, billions are lost each year to inefficiency, human bottlenecks, and regulatory complexity. What began as a movement toward decentralization has, in practice, recreated many of the same structural failures of legacy systems, censorship, corruption and coordination breakdowns, only with higher costs and lower accountability.
## The Cost of Censorship
Censorship has evolved from a matter of platform policy into a deeply embedded systemic challenge, one with economic, legal, cultural, and human consequences. While moderation is necessary to curb harmful or illegal content, today’s censorship mechanisms have created a costly, fragile, and ultimately unsustainable system.
The burden of enforcing moderation at global scale, managing content filters, human review, appeals, and compliance, now defines the business model of large digital platforms. Companies collectively spend billions of dollars each year maintaining these systems, a figure that continues to grow under the pressure of new laws such as the EU Digital Services Act and other regional regulations. Compliance itself has become a structural tax on innovation: costs often reach into the hundreds of millions, yet remain jurisdictionally bound, creating regulatory asymmetry between centralized and decentralized systems. Centralized firms absorb the legal and operational liabilities, while decentralized architectures, though still immature, remain largely beyond national reach.
### Economic and Institutional Impact
Censorship has become an economic inefficiency as much as a political issue. The result is a two-tier internet economy: well-funded incumbents managing rising regulatory debt, and emerging players unable to compete under those same rules.
#### Revenue Erosion
Demonetization policies, advertiser boycotts, and “brand safety” filters reduce income for creators and limit platform diversity.
#### Barrier to Entry
Startups and mid-sized platforms cannot afford compliance infrastructure, locking innovation behind capital and legal expertise.
#### Legal Exposure
Moderation-related lawsuits, settlements, and reputational fallout have become recurring costs of doing business.
### Cultural and Social Consequences
Overreach in censorship creates a chilling effect on public discourse. Creators, researchers, and users self-censor to avoid algorithmic penalties or reputational harm. Minority viewpoints and controversial findings are disproportionately silenced under vague or inconsistently enforced policies.
As trust erodes, users migrate toward fringe or unregulated platforms, reinforcing ideological echo chambers and accelerating social polarization. What emerges is a fractured information ecosystem, one that weakens open dialogue, narrows cultural expression, and undermines the democratic value of communication itself.
### Human Cost and User Disempowerment
Deplatforming now carries material consequences: lost income, erased digital identity, and social isolation, often without due process. Automated moderation systems compound this harm by harvesting behavioral data, amplifying surveillance and algorithmic bias. The result is widespread alienation: users feel monitored, misrepresented, and powerless within the systems they depend on.
### Systemic Risk to Institutions
At an institutional level, censorship introduces volatility. Stock drops, shareholder lawsuits, and regulatory penalties routinely follow high-profile moderation controversies. Executives are forced to navigate conflicting pressures from regulators, investors, and activist user bases, a no-win governance loop that damages brand trust and market stability.
### Real-World Illustrations
#### Facebook–Cambridge Analytica
Demonstrated how data misuse and opaque moderation can destabilize democratic processes.
#### Apple in China
Local data hosting under authoritarian regimes compromises user safety and company integrity.
#### Covid-19 Content Bans
Platforms penalized legitimate discourse later validated by evidence, eroding long-term credibility.
#### TikTok
State-linked surveillance concerns fuel national bans and public distrust, impacting billions in enterprise value.
### The Structural Reality
Censorship is no longer just about moderation, it is a systemic liability embedded in the infrastructure of the modern internet. It distorts markets, suppresses creativity, and exacerbates political fragmentation. The economic costs fall on companies and creators alike, while the social costs degrade freedom, trust, and diversity of thought.
If the internet is to remain a space of progress and participation, censorship must be recognized for what it has become: a bottleneck to innovation, prosperity, and human agency.
## The Hidden Cost of Corruption
Corruption is more than a moral failure, it is a systemic drag on economic efficiency, institutional legitimacy, and social stability. Across both public and private sectors, corrupt practices introduce distortions that inflate costs, erode trust, and suppress innovation.
Whether through bribery, cronyism, nepotism, or opaque contracting, corruption channels value away from productivity and into protectionism. It favors entrenched interests over merit, slows competition, and drives capital and talent toward fairer markets.
### Economic and Institutional Impact
Corruption is effectively a hidden tax on society, one that compounds over time. As corruption becomes normalized, a culture of impunity and disengagement spreads. Bright talent leaves, innovation stalls, and institutions collapse inward under the weight of self-interest.
#### Public Funds
Infrastructure, healthcare, and education budgets are hollowed out through inflated contracts, misallocation, and kickbacks.
#### Investor Confidence
Untransparent markets deter foreign investment and raise the perceived risk of doing business.
#### Competition
Honest enterprises are crowded out by politically connected firms, weakening innovation and long-term growth.
#### Institutional Erosion
Courts, regulators, and media lose credibility when influence supersedes accountability.
#### Social Consequences
Inequality widens as those with least access to power bear the greatest burden of inefficiency.
### Corporate and Market Risk
Corruption doesn’t just harm governments, it destabilizes corporations and investor portfolios. Executives are often forced to navigate dual governance systems, the official and the informal, where success depends less on performance and more on access. Every hour spent managing political risk or damage control is an hour diverted from innovation and growth.
#### Legal Exposure
Fines, compliance failures, and cross-border investigations drain resources.
#### Reputational Damage
Scandals trigger shareholder lawsuits and long-term brand erosion.
#### Capital Flight
ESG-conscious investors divest from opaque or ethically compromised markets.
#### Internal Decline
Employees and customers disengage when integrity is compromised.
### Structural Implications
In a global economy moving toward transparency and trustless verification, opacity has become a competitive liability. Companies entangled in corrupt systems lose access to capital, partnerships, and legitimacy. Governments that fail to modernize governance frameworks fall behind in attracting digital and financial innovation.
Corruption replaces value creation with value extraction, fairness with favoritism, and resilience with fragility. Tackling it is not just a moral imperative, it is an economic necessity for any system seeking to scale sustainably in the age of decentralized and algorithmic trust.
## Barriers to Blockchain Adoption
Despite its promise of decentralization and financial empowerment, blockchain adoption remains limited by a set of deep, interlocking barriers, technical, cultural, legal, and experiential. The technology exists, but the systems built atop it often replicate the same fragilities of centralized architectures.
### The Myth of Decentralization
Much of what is marketed as “decentralized” remains structurally centralized. Many applications depend on custodial wallets controlled by third parties, venture capital–dominated governance models, and Centralized web servers and APIs.
These dependencies reintroduce the very points of failure blockchain was designed to eliminate. They leave systems vulnerable to regulation, censorship, or internal capture, where a handful of actors quietly steer supposedly democratic networks.
### Cultural and Governance Fragmentation
The blockchain ecosystem suffers from community tribalism, a culture that prizes loyalty to chains over collaboration. This discourages constructive critique, slows the creation of shared standards, and undermines interoperability. Meanwhile, governance models remain fragile: low voter participation and opaque decision-making mirror the inefficiencies of legacy bureaucracy rather than improving upon them.
### Regulatory Uncertainty
Across jurisdictions, laws governing blockchain, DeFi, and digital assets are inconsistent, vague, or in flux. Compliance risk is high for both users and developers, deterring mainstream adoption. This ambiguity forces projects to operate defensively, focusing on avoiding penalties rather than creating value, and leaves enterprises cautious to engage.
### Censorship at the Infrastructure Layer
Even decentralized protocols depend on centralized infrastructure: web hosting (e.g., IPFS gateways), cloud providers, domain registries, and app stores. These choke points expose blockchain projects to deplatforming, content delisting, and unilateral takedowns, revealing a layer of fragility beneath the rhetoric of immutability.
### Poor User Experience
Despite years of progress, blockchain UX remains one of the largest barriers to mass adoption.
- Key management is error-prone and unforgiving.
- Wallets are fragmented, non-intuitive, and inconsistent across chains.
- Gas fees and transaction signing remain intimidating for newcomers.
- Mistakes are often permanent and costly.
The result is a user experience that caters to experts and excludes the mainstream.
### Architectural and Developer Constraints
On-chain systems struggle with real-time performance, making them unsuitable for streaming, gaming, or live data. Layer 2 solutions and micropayments offer theoretical scalability, but adoption lags due to UX complexity and integration challenges.
For developers, the burden is steep: learning new languages (Solidity, Rust, Move), managing wallets and gas, securing smart contracts, and dealing with cross-chain fragmentation. One mistake can permanently lock or destroy assets, amplifying risk and mental load.
### Security and Fragmentation
Cross-chain bridges, oracles, and smart contracts remain high-risk vectors. Vulnerabilities, from reentrancy and flash loan attacks to oracle manipulation, have cost users billions. Meanwhile, fragmented insurance markets fail to provide consistent coverage or trust guarantees.
### Identity, Recovery, and Real-World Integration
Lost private keys still mean lost assets. Promising innovations like account abstraction and social recovery remain niche. There is no unified identity layer across ecosystems, making onboarding and recovery painful.
Beyond DeFi, real-world utility remains scarce. Most applications revolve around speculation, token trading, or yield generation. Enterprise use cases, in supply chains, media, healthcare, or governance, are rare, clunky, or stuck in pilot phases due to unclear ROI and regulatory friction.
# Value Proposition
---
Unsudo is the operating system for Polkadot JAM, transforming the complexity of parallel blockchain infrastructure into an intuitive and modular developer platform. By abstracting away JAM’s technical hurdles, Unsudo empowers developers to deploy DAOs, dApps, and autonomous services in days rather than months. Our mission is to make decentralization practical: resilient, scalable, and transparent enough to enable seamless global collaboration.
## Onchain Infrastructure
At the core of Unsudo is a fully on-chain infrastructure that delivers resilience, immutability, and self-sovereignty. Unlike traditional server-based solutions, our approach ensures that DAOs and services remain robust even as contributors change, while providing verifiable, auditable, and trustless operations. By running natively on-chain, Unsudo enables cross-border collaboration and autonomous execution, allowing protocols to manage day-to-day operations without constant human intervention. Its modular design makes upgrading and scaling frictionless, ensuring that the platform is not just a tool, but a durable foundation for decentralized institutions.
## Rust as Strategic Foundation
Unsudo’s foundation in Rust provides a significant competitive advantage over Solidity and other environments. Rust combines performance, safety, and versatility, making it ideal for building scalable decentralized infrastructure. It democratizes technology by being accessible across platforms and capable of running even on low-powered devices, allowing developers of varying skill levels to produce high-quality, robust code. Rust’s memory-safe design eliminates entire classes of runtime errors, while strong static typing and compile-time checks reduce logic mistakes before deployment. Its system-level performance allows code to compile to high-performance WebAssembly with deterministic execution, supporting asynchronous logic and multithreading for real-time collaborative applications. Rust also enables custom runtimes, freeing developers from the constraints of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, while providing a unified ecosystem of tooling and libraries that streamline development and reduce operational complexity.
## Algorithmic Governance and Mathematical Precision
Unsudo is more than a DAO platform; it is a research-driven experiment in deterministic, unbiased governance. Human governance is inherently flawed, prone to bias, emotion, and inconsistency. True decentralization requires minimizing subjective influence, and Unsudo envisions a DAO that is autonomous, rational, and transparent, guided by algorithmic processes and mathematical principles. By delegating day-to-day operations to the DAO itself, Unsudo reduces reliance on a few members and mitigates vulnerabilities from low participation or quorum issues. Decisions are executed according to deterministic mathematical formulas, creating a governance system that acts logically, consistently, and in the collective interest. Unsudo’s approach transforms DAOs from tools for coordination into autonomous institutions capable of self-governance, resilient to volatile environments, and designed to serve their communities sustainably.
## Abstract Execution Layer
The abstract execution layer of Unsudo ensures that both developers and end-users can interact with blockchain infrastructure without needing to manage low-level technical complexities. It allows rapid prototyping and seamless upgrades, enabling teams to experiment, integrate, and iterate at their own pace. Governance, treasury, rewards, and automation modules are pre-built and plug-and-play, making integration fast and safe. Unsudo supports cross-chain connections and external APIs, facilitating interoperability and collaboration across ecosystems. Participation costs are predictable and minimal, while execution is ultra-fast, providing a real-time, seamless experience even for large groups. For end-users, DAOs can be created and managed through familiar web and mobile interfaces, without requiring knowledge of web3, wallets, or smart contracts, allowing anyone to participate in decentralized governance with ease and confidence.
# Governance
---
Unsudo introduces next-generation DAO models that leverage algorithms for unbiased decision-making, contrasting traditional organizational structures. Governance is designed to be largely autonomous, mathematically deterministic, and resilient, minimizing human error while aligning incentives across the community and protocol participants.
## Dual Chamber System
Much like a government, Unsudo operates with a dual-chamber system. The community, holding UDO tokens, can vote on proposals that directly alter protocol code or authorize fund transfers. The council serves as a representative body with oversight functions. It cannot pass proposals independently; instead, it ensures community-backed decisions and holds temporary veto power over malicious actions. Over time, as the DAO matures, the council’s role diminishes, with governance becoming entirely community-driven.

Proposals require approval from both chambers. The council’s veto acts as a safeguard against malicious proposals but cannot override legitimate community consensus.
### Veto
The council has the temporary authority to cancel malicious proposals. This mechanism ensures early-stage security and accountability. While council members act as representatives, their role is transitional, supporting the DAO until it reaches full self-governance.
### Electoral System
STV Single Transferable Vote
Ranked
## Proposal
### Timelock
Proposals incorporate a timelock mechanism to ensure stakeholders have sufficient notice before execution.
#### Quorum
Each proposal requires a minimum quorum, reflecting both community engagement and council oversight.
#### Stalemate
In case of a stalemate, algorithmic rules determine a fair resolution, ensuring progress without central intervention.
## Tokenomics
The maximum UDO supply is capped at 1,000,000 tokens. Token distribution and governance participation are structured to align incentives and long-term protocol health.

### Vesting
Vesting schedules are linear, unlocking per second from the Token Generation Event (TGE). Algorithmic governance adjusts unlock rates based on protocol performance and market conditions. This ensures fairness, protects against market volatility, and aligns long-term stakeholder incentives.
### Liquidity Planning
Unsudo prioritizes decentralization and initially plans to list on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). A reserve of 50,000 UDO tokens is allocated for liquidity provisioning.
### Compliance & Legal Framework
UDO is a governance and commodity token, controlled algorithmically rather than by any individual or administration. The DAO operates as self-sovereign, independent of national jurisdictions. KYC/AML requirements only apply where exchanges may mandate them. Legal wrappers may be introduced as needed.
### Unlock Rate Mechanism
Unlocks are algorithmic, fair, and transparent. Rates adjust based on protocol performance, helping manage supply during bear markets while incentivizing stakeholders to maintain ecosystem health.
## Treasury
### Purpose & Philosophy
The Unsudo Treasury functions as a self-sovereign, algorithmically-influenced financial backbone. It funds protocol development, incentivizes contributors, and sustains public goods in a decentralized, trustless manner.
### Revenue Stream
Funds originate from protocol fees, grants, donations, token sales, and service fees
#### Donation
Donations can come from individuals, DAOs, philanthropists, or foundations. KYC may apply for large contributions. Donations are accepted via smart contracts, multisig wallets, or platform integrations, and can optionally confer recognition, NFTs, or governance rights.
#### Grant
Grants may be provided by Web3 foundations, universities, NGOs, or corporate ecosystem funds. Eligible grants fund R&D, protocol development, governance tooling, or educational initiatives. Fund management is transparent and tracked via public dashboards.
#### Sponsorship
Sponsors provide funding for branding, feature development, or community initiatives. Sponsorship frameworks define tiers, contributions, and permissible influence. Revenue from sponsors is allocated to treasury goals, public goods, or R&D.
### Spending Strategy
Treasury allocations include bounties, contributor rewards, public goods funding, ecosystem grants, strategic investments, liquidity provisioning, and emergency reserves. Policies include quarterly spending caps, community-approved budgets, and emergency drawdown mechanisms.
### Reserve Strategy & Buffer Management
The treasury maintains a mix of liquid and long-term assets, including stablecoins and major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, DOT). Algorithmic triggers rebalance reserves in response to token price fluctuations or volatility.
### Transparency and Reporting
All treasury inflows and outflows are fully transparent via on-chain dashboards, multisig logs, and periodic public reporting.
### Governance
Treasury decisions are made through DAO voting, council oversight, and algorithmic mechanisms. Emergency vetoes and proposal thresholds ensure checks and balances.
### Security
Funds are secured with multisig and hardware wallets. Future plans include autonomous smart contract-controlled treasury operations, with contingency protocols for disputes or key loss.
### Growth Policy
The treasury reinvests through yield strategies, staking, and buybacks, creating runway for long-term sustainability and acting as a backstop against economic shocks.
## Community Input & Market Validation
The DAO continuously incorporates feedback and validation from the community to ensure decisions remain aligned with participant interests, market realities, and ecosystem growth.
# Market Opportunity
---
The Polkadot ecosystem is rapidly expanding, with developer adoption growing roughly 25% year-over-year after JAM testnets. By 2026, there will be over 500,000 blockchain developers globally, yet fewer than 15% have the expertise to build directly at runtime or service-layer levels. JAM itself enables unprecedented capabilities—elastic scaling, asynchronous compute, flexible Coretime orchestration, and throughput exceeding 600,000 transactions per second—but harnessing this power directly requires deep technical knowledge.

As a Layer 1.5 protocol, Unsudo sits atop JAM, providing a composable, developer-friendly platform that abstracts low-level complexities while exposing JAM’s full computational power. By offering SDKs, prebuilt modules, automation frameworks, and standardized protocols, Unsudo lowers the barrier to entry for developers, enterprises, and DAOs. This positions Unsudo as a foundational layer for a broad range of applications, from decentralized organizations and real-time enterprise networks to AI/IoT integrations.
## Problem Statement
JAM transforms the Polkadot relay chain into a parallelized compute layer, enabling permissionless, asynchronous execution of services. While JAM can technically handle almost any computation, developing directly in its core environment introduces multiple challenges.
- Managing asynchronous service lifecycles (Refine/Accumulate/onTransfer).
- Coordinating Coretime for deterministic execution.
- Handling complex data-availability and service-to-service orchestration.
- Designing reliable, composable logic at runtime.
This complexity makes building directly on JAM slow and error-prone, comparable to programming in low-level assembly. Teams must dedicate significant technical expertise and resources just to deploy scalable applications, limiting broader adoption. Legacy blockchain infrastructures introduce additional friction, such as high transaction costs, slot auctions, and limited composability, further constraining developers and enterprises.
### For Developers
#### Technical Complexity
Building scalable, cross-chain applications requires mastering JAM-specific APIs, smart contract languages (Rust, Ink!), and asynchronous orchestration patterns. Infrastructure challenges like node management and Coretime coordination create steep onboarding barriers.
#### Infrastructure Overhead
Running and maintaining compute resources, parachains, or smart contracts demands time, expertise, and operational resources. Many platforms lack reusable modules for governance, treasury, and workflow automation, forcing teams to rebuild core functionality from scratch.
##### Cost and Resource Uncertainty
Infrastructure and deployment costs can fluctuate unpredictably. Competition for grants, Coretime allocations, and network resources is intense, disincentivizing smaller teams from participating.
##### Integration and Extensibility
Frequent protocol updates or low modularity in legacy systems can break integrations, requiring ongoing maintenance. Developers need a composable layer that shields them from such volatility while enabling rapid feature 
development.
## How JAM Enables Layer 1.5 Innovation
JAM is a hyper-scalable, sharded “blockchain supercomputer” capable of over 600,000 transactions per second, with native asynchronous support and permissionless service deployment. For a Layer 1.5 protocol like UNSUDO, this creates an opportunity to provide a higher-level, composable runtime that standardizes complex patterns, manages orchestration, and exposes powerful primitives for developers.

Unsudo enables applications that were previously infeasible: real-time enterprise coordination, instant payroll and settlement systems, composable governance frameworks, on-chain IoT workflows, and modular AI service layers. By abstracting JAM’s low-level complexity, Unsudo allows developers to focus on application logic rather than system-level orchestration, reducing time to market and operational overhead.
## How and Which Problems Unsudo Addresses
As a Layer 1.5 protocol, Unsudo tackles JAM’s adoption barriers by providing:
- SDKs and prebuilt modules that standardize complex runtime operations
- Composable frameworks for governance, treasury, and workflow automation
- Transparent, algorithmic management tools that handle Coretime, asynchronous services, and resource allocation
- A development environment that reduces infrastructure overhead and deployment risk

By acting as an accessible layer atop JAM, Unsudo transforms JAM’s raw computational power into a broadly usable platform for developers, DAOs, enterprises, and emerging Web3 applications. It bridges the gap between JAM’s technical capabilities and the real-world needs of builders, unlocking new markets and use cases across the Polkadot ecosystem.
# Roadmap
---
## Long Term
The long-term vision for Unsudo is to evolve into a fully self-sufficient protocol, capable of operating without direct human intervention. Governance and operations will be predominantly algorithmic, allowing the system to autonomously perform electoral processes, rebalance assets, and maintain overall protocol health.

A globally distributed community will still take ownership of the protocol, ensuring democratic oversight and the ability to update or modify the system. While human governance via council structures remains important for guiding growth and ecosystem development, the protocol’s design minimizes central points of failure, making operations more resilient, secure, and scalable.

The ultimate goal is a self-governing, algorithmically managed platform that balances human oversight with autonomous functionality, empowering both the community and the protocol to thrive without compromise.

# System Architecture
---
Unsudo prioritizes deliberate planning and quality over rapid development. Its architecture is designed for security, cross-platform compatibility, and resilient governance.
## Rust
Rust is a core language in Unsudo due to its memory safety, compile-time guarantees, and avoidance of common EVM and Solidity vulnerabilities such as reentrancy and overflow. Its cross-platform support allows execution on-chain, off-chain, via CLI, mobile devices, and even edge nodes, enabling global participation in resource-constrained environments.
## Polkadot & Join Accumulate Machine (JAM)
Polkadot underpins Unsudo through the Join Accumulate Machine, or JAM, which functions as the kernel of the protocol. JAM provides a modular, flexible, and cost-efficient execution environment that supports actor-based asynchronous services. These services run on demand using Coretime, a system of purchasable execution bandwidth slices rented from Polkadot validators. Coretime decouples execution from consensus, enabling scheduled and burst compute, which is critical for Unsudo’s governance and operational services.
### Coretime
Coretime allows services to schedule workloads flexibly rather than paying per transaction. This abstraction enables freemium execution models, background computation, and coordinated governance tasks without imposing direct costs on end users.
### JAM Services
Services on JAM are first-class entities that include metadata defining their purpose and permissioning, bytecode written in WASM-compatible languages, and entrypoints like `refine()` and `accumulate()`. These services can suspend and resume execution, orchestrate multi-agent collaboration, and automate governance logic.
### CorePlay: Actor-Based Runtime
CorePlay is an experimental actor-model runtime built atop JAM. It supports autonomous agents that maintain local state, communicate asynchronously across cores or synchronously when co-located, and can spawn other agents. This model allows encapsulation of policies, governance rules, and treasury strategies as independent, auditable, and resilient agents. Execution is metered by PVM weights, with approximately six-second slots per agent, while cross-core messaging incurs additional costs. Coretime can be prepaid by the protocol or passed through
### Use Cases
CorePlay and JAM enable a wide range of applications, including patchlet execution for protocol upgrades, long-running governance threads, election agents, DAO watchdogs, and automated recovery routines.
## System Layering
Unsudo can be considered a Layer 1.5 environment. The underlying structure includes:
- Layer 0: Polkadot relay chain, Cosmos, and libp2p networks.
- Layer 1: Parachains such as JAM, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, and Avalanche.
- Layer 2: Scaling solutions like zkSync, Optimism, Polygon PoS, and Raiden.
- Layer 3: Applications including wallets and dApps.

Layer 1.5 refers to an embedded executor within the main chain runtime, where native services, shared state, and optional zero-knowledge proofs operate directly.
## PVM & Resilience
Polkadot’s PVM operates as a stack machine on a distributed CPU and memory architecture, with permanent storage provided by ParityDB or NOMT. JAM serves as the kernel with ELVES consensus for block finality. RISC-V embedded variants optimize low-level execution, supporting long-running WASM services such as Synth, which utilize Fuel, a token-based staking system for prepaid compute.
## Development Workflow
Unsudo integrates a Git-compliant workflow for service and protocol upgrades, allowing users to clone repositories, manage branches, and submit pull requests directly via CLI. Addressing is supported by a native ENS-style subsystem, providing human-readable addresses for accounts and services.
## Future Enhancements
Planned features include advanced address generation, simulator modules, encryption improvements, and interoperability with other chains such as Bifrost.
