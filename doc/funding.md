# Name
Unsudo - Layer 1.5 on top of Polkadot JAM
# Description

# How does Unsudo integrate into the Polkadot Ecosystem
- Polkadot has a vision of tools and chains being used on top of JAM to target many groups. We are building Layer 1.5 on top of Polkadot JAM, which will focus on delivering to ??? some specific niche ???.
- We will use Polkadot's speed and gas-less tools to offer less obtrusive experiences to web2 people. And try to get them to enjoy web3 without having to know its web3.
- We are focuing on attracting web2 and web3 developers, we are abstracting the low level functionality of JAM so it is safe and easier to use for the dev community. 
- DAO and community
- We are tools that solve the problem
- Polkadot is like a Power plant, and we are like a transformer, and users can easily plug into us and connect power to their homes
# Why is our team interested in this project?
UK. ... talk about whitepaper
Values based pitch (for polkadot), 
cost based pitch,
needs based pitch - We also want to build on something like this (depends on the research on target audience) (for polkadot)
# 1 Minute Video Pitch
# Project Details
Expected final state - vision
- tech stack - rust rust rust, dioxus, wasm, typescript | python, tui, web app
- documentation of core components, protocols, architecture to be deployed:
	- ...
- Research - case, market research
	- why web2 devs dont turn to web3? (what do they care about?)
	- research censorship? 
	- additional resource 1 to 1 talk to users and what we found out
	- primary sources, secondary sources form to unsudo, other discord groups
- mock ups of ui components - head of arts??
	- what components??
	- custom wallet on dapp
	- tui??
- data models and api spec -> rust docs and src...
- requirement
	- what are we trying to do
		- A layer 1.5.
		- Make it easy for web2 devs to jump into web3.
		- Abstract JAM.
	- and what are we not trying to do
		- Not trying to make a layer 2.0 or parachain.
		- Not going to be building another JAM.
		- Not going bankrupt

## Target Audience
- Devs
- Rust devs
- Good rust devs
- ???
## What needs does the project meet
- needs research
## Are the any more projects like us?
Astra and parachains but they dont they are standalone, Unsudo is 1.5 which means its built into. Across web3 and why we have an advantage or why we are better than others in web3 and in polkadot
